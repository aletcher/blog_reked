Hi! I'm Alec. This blog is a little attempt to share some writings.

You will found a few "essays" in the (Essays)[https://google.com] section of the blog, about various topics. Most of them are attempts to find a ("Middle Way")[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_Way] between extreme view points, to avoid falling into the polarisation that plagues social-media platforms in this day & age. This is the origin behind the name of the blog, ***Riding the Ridge***.

I will also post a little poetry, from time to time, in the (Poetry)[https://google.com] section... I am no poet (nor essayist), but I love to write just the same, and hope you might like some of them. Some of the poems will be in my mother-tongue, French, but I will hopefully post a few in English as well.

I truly wish some of this will be useful to someone, somewhere. I would love to receive your messages, opinions, feedback, criticisms. You can comment directly on the corresponding blog posts, or reach out to me directly (HERE).
