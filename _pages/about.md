Welcome! I'm Alec. This blog is a little experiment in sharing a few things I've been writing lately.

The name, ***Riding the Ridge***, means to hold opposite ideas together. To walk along the tension they create, and marvel at both sides with birds' eyes.
 <!-- To tread along the [Middle Way](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_Way); to be in harmony with the natural balance between opposites. -->

*A snow-traveler, riding the ridge.*

The name comes out of a desire to push back against an overly polarised society. To find commonality, and a shared sense of purpose, even as -- *especially when* -- we disagree. Which is not to say we are to become liquid, lukewarm, evergreen -- to hold no opinion about anything. Quite the contrary. It is to sustain the complexity of the world, to find nuance, and to know that different situations call for different answers. A wise man is not without conviction: he is sufficiently eagle-eyed and compassionate to see through his opponent's eyes, and thus, to be open to civilised debate.

I am desperately far from this wise man's mind. But I hope this blog will be a place to keep track of our attempts to ridge ridges, and our inevitable failures along the way. And finding commonality cannot be a one-man job. My dream would be for this blog to become a conversation. So I would love to receive your messages, opinions, feedback, criticism, questions, answers. You can comment directly on each blog post, or reach out to me directly using the form below. In the near future I will setup a newsletter where we can keep this conversation going, on a weekly rhythm.

**[Essays.](../essays)** Random "essays" about anything and everything. Take light-heartedly.

**[Poems.](../poems)** I am no poet (nor essayist), but I love to write just the same, and hope some of them will mean something to you. Some are strongly related to the idea of holding opposites together. Others not. Some will be in my mother-tongue, French, but I will try to post a few in English as well.

**[Dancing.](../dancing)** Sometimes I go places and dance. I often start with a sensation, or a feeling, or a part of the body I am trying to listen to better, and see where it takes me. Sometimes people ask me to share these little dances with them. I don't have Instagram, and I'm all against the 2D flatness of it, but sometimes it's good to let go and just share things you enjoy doing with others.

I truly hope this experiment will be useful to someone, somewhere. The point of life, I think, is *to bloom* (ask any flower), and I wish nothing less for you.
